Readme for JavaScript code
Description
This JavaScript code generates a random background color for a webpage when the user clicks a button. The color code is also displayed in a paragraph element.

Usage
To use this code, simply include the HTML and CSS files in your project and link to the JavaScript file in the HTML file. The HTML file contains a button element with the ID "bu" and a paragraph element with the ID "p2". The CSS file contains the styling for these elements, including the background color of the page.

When the user clicks the button, the function "change2()" is called. This function generates a random color code by selecting random values from an array of hexadecimal digits, and sets the background color of the webpage and the text content of the "p2" element to the generated color code.
